				An understanding of three different areas is essential
				for those who wish to become successful sports bettors:
			</p>
			<ul style="padding: 10px; padding-left: 20px;">
				<a href="#odds"><li>Odds and statistics</li></a>
				<a href="#sport"><li>The sport itself</li></a>
				<a href="#lines"><li>Line movement and public opinion</li></a>
			</ul>
			<hr>

			<h3 id="odds">Odds and statistics</h3>
			<h5 class="return">[<a href="#">back to top</a>]</h5>
			<p>
				Every bet has its own odds,
				that determine how much a bettor stands to win should his or her selection succeed.
				There are three common odds formats:
			</p>
			<ul style="padding: 5px; padding-left: 30px;">
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Decimal</u> odds are perhaps the most straightforward format.
						Multiply your stake by the odds to calculate your potential returns upon success.
						Subtract your stake from the returns to calculate profit.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Fractional</u> odds are the most commonly-used format in the UK.
						Multiply your stake by the odds to calculate your potential profit upon success.
						Add on your stake to the profit number to calculate total returns.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<u>Moneyline</u> odds are the most commonly-used format in the United States.
						Odds are always either positive or negative.
						Positive odds indicate how much the bettor would profit on a stake of &pound;100.
						Negative odds indicate how much the bettor needs to stake to profit &pound;100.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				With these odds, it can be determined how much of the time, theoretically,
				the selection must succeed in order for the bettor to break even.
				For example, betting Man Utd to win at 1/4 (or 1.25 or -400),
				they're required to win 80% of the time for the bettor to break even
				(1 divided by 1.25 = 0.8).
				The percentage number above represents the bet's implied probability of success.
				The implied probability should be compared
				to the bettor's predicted probability of success.
				To do this, the bettor must consult his or her own sports knowledge,
				by "capping" the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				To convert odds or calculate implied probabilities, you can use the
				<a href="../tools/odds-converter.html">BetGio odds converter</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Typically, the sum of implied probabilities
				for all selections in an event will exceed 100%.
				For example, if Man Utd are at 1/4,
				Bournemouth are at 10/1, and the Draw is at 5/1,
				then the implied probabilities are 80%, 9%, 17%, respectively.
				Thus, the sum of implied probabilities is 106%.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount by which the above number exceeds 100% (in this case, 6%),
				is known as "the juice".
				It exists to provide the bookmaker with a statistical edge,
				to ensure long term profitability.
				For a bettor to be successful, they need to be able to overcome this statistical edge.
				Knowledge of the betting subject (in this case, the sport),
				and of betting line movement, are required to do so.
			</p>

			<h5 class="return">[<a href="#">back to top</a>]</h5>
			<p>
				Before making any bets, the probabilties of different outcomes need to be considered.
				The bettor should calculate the chance of success for each outcome,
				using his or her own sports knowledge and perspective.
				For example, to continue with the last example,
				the bettor predicts the probability of a Man Utd win, a Bournemouth win, and a Draw.
				Let's say the bettor projects 77%, 8%, and 15%, for each outcome, respectively.
				All three projected probabilities are lower than the implied probabilities.
				Thus, the bettor <i>shouldn't</i> place a bet at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, let's say a different bettor has a different opinion about the event.
				This bettor projects probabilities of 88%, 4%, and 8%, respectively.
				The projected probability of 88% for a Man Utd win is higher than
				the implied probability of 80%.
				Thus, per this bettor's sporting knowledge, there's value in a bet on a Man Utd win.
			</p>
			<p>
				To determine how much a bettor should bet on a given selection,
				bankroll management and overlay need to be considered.
				These subjects are covered in the site's
				<a href="sports2.html">advanced concepts</a> section.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bettor's projected probabilities must be accurate the vast majority of the time.
				Thus, a bettor's knowledge of the betting subject is vital for long-term betting success.
			</p>
			<p>
				There's a natural drawback to this reality, in that it's a catch-22 dilemma:
				Knowledge of a sport is generally tied directly to enjoyment of a sport.
				Meanwhile, permanently attaching monetary significance
				to the sport can damage the bettor's enjoyment of the sport,
				which in effect can damage the bettor's knowledge of the sport.
				It's important that the bettor maintains an awareness of this drawback at all times.
			</p>
			<hr>
		<!-- new section -->
			<h3 id="lines">Line movement and public opinion</h3>
			<h5 class="return">[<a href="#">back to top</a>]</h5>
			<p>
				There are some mainstream misconceptions
				regarding how betting lines are created and maintained.
				While bookmakers <i>do</i> project the outcomes of events,
				especially prior to the lines being released,
				the lines are largely dictated by the general public.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally, bookmakers want to receive an even amount of money
				on all selections across an event.
				This is to guarantee profitability, taking the aforementioned "juice" into account.
				To achieve this, bookmakers set lines by monitoring public opinion,
				and then predicting public betting.
				Lines are adjusted as bets are made.
				For example, if a bettor places a large wager on a particular selection,
				that selection's odds will shorten,
				and opposing selections' odds will lengthen.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's equally important for bettors to monitor line movement as it is for bookmakers.
				To do this, the bettor needs to maintain an awareness of
				the betting public and the sport's fanbase,
				as well as an awareness of the sport itself.
				The aim is to bet any and all selections at their best possible prices.
				For example, holding off on betting -250 expecting the line to move,
				then getting odds of -210, results in greater than 5% more returns.
				While this amount may seem small at first sight,
				it's a significant increase, and is often greater than the "juice".
				Over the long term, these sorts of increases will make a big difference.
