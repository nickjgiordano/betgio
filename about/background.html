				BetGio was founded in May 2017 at MidKent College.
			</p>
			<p>
				BetGio aims to provide a quality service for bettors,
				offering advice and tools for general betting techniques,
				as well as tips for the chosen betting subject,
				be it sports or online poker.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the core of the site is the blog,
				featuring sports betting and poker tips based on current events.
				Various sports are covered, from football, to tennis, to boxing, to MMA, and more.
				The site's experts cover these sports on a day-to-day basis,
				and post pertinent information for bettors to take under consideration
				when making their bets.
				The world of online poker (specifically Texas Hold'em) is also covered,
				as the biggest sites are monitored to post all the latest news
				and tips for when and where to play.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from blogging,
				BetGio aims to offer general betting strategy and calculation tools,
				to assist bettors in their pursuits.
				These strategies range from the basics of what's required to be a successful bettor,
				to advanced strategies for experienced bettors.
				The site provides ancillary betting tools for these purposes,
				including odds converters and calculators,
				bet arbitrage calculators, and poker probability utilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				An important goal of the site is to develop an active community of bettors,
				through the forums.
				The forums are used not just to discuss everything related to sports and betting,
				but also for general discussions, from day-to-day life,
				to subjects such as movies, television, music, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving forward, BetGio plans to offer a subscription service to its users.
				Subscribers will have access to a second,
				more frequently-updated, and more in-depth blog.
				In addition to that, a subscription would come
				with a licence to download and use the BetGio Betting Assistant application.
				Finally, the subscription will also grant users “VIP” status on the forums,
				providing additional forum access and functionality.
